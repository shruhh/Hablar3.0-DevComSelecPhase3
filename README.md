# hablar 3.0

A new Flutter and Firebase project for DevCom selection Phase 3.

This is my first Flutter project, suggestions are always welcomed.
This is a chat app which uses Flutter for front end dev and Firebase for back end dev.
Some snapshots of the app are also attached.

For help getting started with Flutter, view

samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
